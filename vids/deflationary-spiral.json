That will decrease demand which persuades sellers to decrease prices and/or supplies. The decrease in price and/or supplies decreases the seller's profits, and results in an increase in employment. If prices decrease, this cycle causes deflation, not inflation."},

The increases in prices and/or supplies increases the seller's profits, and gives them reason to employ more people. If prices increase, this cycle does cause inflation."}
